## ‚úÖ Validation & Formatting

All JSON data must:

- Be **valid JSON** (use 2-space indentation).
- Conform to the **matching schema** (in `/schemas`).
- Include `"$schema"` and `meta` fields in top-level JSON files:
  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "https://open.skuba.app/schemas/certifications/dive-certifications.schema.v1.0.0.json",
    "meta": {
      "version": "2025.10",
      "generated_at": "2025-10-31T00:00:00Z"
    },
    "certifications": [...]
  }
  ```

* Use UTF-8 encoding.
* Avoid trailing commas.

You can validate locally with:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

Or validate individual files with:

```bash
npx ajv validate \
  -s schemas/certifications/dive-certifications.schema.v1.0.0.json \
  -d datasets/certifications.json
```

## üß© Dataset Contributions

For new or updated datasets:

- Include all required fields as defined in the schema.
- Keep **data factual** and verifiable.
- For certifications:
  - Include agency, prerequisites, equivalencies, and limits.
  - Use plain text for limits (free-form list).
- For agencies:
  - Include full name, abbreviation, website, and region.
  - **IMPORTANT:** When adding a new agency, you must also add the corresponding agency logo to `assets/agency-logos/`. Logo files should be named using the pattern `agency-{id}.{svg|png}` (e.g., `agency-padi.svg`).

Refer to the schema files in `/schemas` for detailed field requirements and examples.

---

## üß± Schema Contributions

For schema updates or new schemas:

- Follow [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema).
- Include a top-level `$id` and `$schema` URL referencing `open.skuba.app`.
- Include `"version"` and `"title"` fields.
- Keep schemas backward-compatible where possible.
  Breaking changes require a new major version (e.g. `v2.0.0`).
- Schema files should be versioned and placed in appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `schemas/certifications/dive-certifications.schema.v1.0.0.json`).

Pull requests that modify schemas will trigger stricter validation checks.

## üé® Visual Contributions

### Agency Logos

When adding or updating agency logos in `assets/agency-logos/`:

- Format: **SVG** preferred, **PNG** accepted (with transparent background).
- File naming: Use the pattern `agency-{id}.{svg|png}` where `{id}` matches the agency ID in the dataset (e.g., `agency-padi.svg`, `agency-ssi.svg`).
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 100KB preferred).
- Ensure logos are clear and recognizable at various sizes.
- **Note:** Agency logos are third-party trademarks. Only include official logos for reference purposes.

### Design Guidelines

For any visual assets:

- Use consistent styling where applicable.
- Run SVG files through an optimizer before committing (`svgo` recommended).
- Include appropriate licensing information (see `assets/*/LICENSE.md` files).

---

## üîé Quality & Style Guidelines

- **No personal or unverifiable data.** Only publish information confirmed via reputable training agency sources.
- **Neutral tone.** Avoid opinions, marketing, or subjective commentary.
- **Keep changes atomic.** Each PR should cover one focused topic (e.g., one schema or one dataset).
